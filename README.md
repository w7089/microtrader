# Docker in Production using AWS - Microtrader Application

This is the sample application for the Pluralsight course Docker in Production using AWS.

The application is based upon the excellent [Vert.x Microservices Workshop](https://github.com/cescoffier/vertx-microservices-workshop), although a number of modifications have been made as outlined below:

- Full continuous delivery workflow using Docker (based upon my course [Continuous Delivery using Docker and Ansible](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/docker-ansible-continuous-delivery))
- Use of Gradle as the multi-project build tool.
- Use of the [Typesafe config library](https://github.com/typesafehub/config) for friendlier 12-factor environment variable based configuration support.
- Use of [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org) for lightweight database migrations
- Some of the individual microservices have been refactored to be more resilient to failure
- Addition of unit/integration tests and acceptance tests

## Application Architecture

The application consists of four Microservices that collectively comprise a simple fictitious stock trading application:

- [Quote Generator](./microtrader-quote) - periodically generates stock market quotes for three fictitious companies
- [Portfolio Service](./microtrader-portfolio) - trades stocks starting from an initial portfolio of $10000 cash on hand.  The trading logic is completely random and non-sensical.
- [Audit Service](./microtrader-audit) - audits all stock trading activity, persisting each stock trade to a database
- [Trader Dashboard](./microtrader-dashboard) - provides a web dashboard displaying stock market quote activity, recent stock trades and the current state of the portfolio.  The dashboard also provides an operational view of the status and service discovery inforamtion for each service.

The application demonstrates several key features of a Microservices architecture and the underlying [Vert.x](http://vertx.io) toolkit that powers the application:

- [Distributed event bus](http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-core/java/#event_bus) - Vert.x supports an asynchronous message driven architecture, with support for common patterns including publish/subscribe, point-to-point, request-response and service proxy RPC messaging.
- [SockJS event bus bridge](http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-web/java/#_sockjs_event_bus_bridge) - this feature allows the event bus to be extended in a secure and controlled fashion to web clients via websockets using the SockJS JavaScript client library.  This provides the ability to create real-time web applications and message client endpoints directly if appropriate.
- [Service discovery](http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-service-discovery/java/) - allows Microservices to discover, locate and interact with other services.  Vert.x includes a simple distributed map structure to store service discovery, however this can be replaced with several popular backends such as Consul and Kubernetes.
- [Circuit breaker pattern](http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-circuit-breaker/java/) - this is a core pattern for larger Microservices architectures that helps prevent cascading failures and handle failures gracefully.
- [Multi reactor pattern](http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-core/java/#_reactor_and_multi_reactor) - Vert.x provides a lightweight and highly performant event loop based scheduling algorithm allowing applications written in an asynchronous, non-blocking manner to scale considerably greater than traditional application architectures.  The Vert.x programming model provides the simplicity of single threaded development for each deployable unit of code, but schedules each deployable unit of code across all available processor cores for maximum concurrency.

## Quick Start

### Building the Application Locally

Before building and running the application locally, your system must have the following prerequisites installed:

- Java JDK 8
- NodeJS 4.x or higher (to install the `npm` package manager)
- Bower (`npm install -g bower`)

You first need to build "fat" jars for each Microservice, using the Gradle shadowJar plugin as shown below:

```
$ ./gradlew clean test shadowJar
...
...
:clean
:microtrader-audit:clean
:microtrader-common:clean
:microtrader-dashboard:clean
:microtrader-portfolio:clean
:microtrader-quote:clean
...

...
...
:shadowJar
:microtrader-audit:shadowJar
:microtrader-common:shadowJar
:microtrader-dashboard:shadowJar
:microtrader-portfolio:shadowJar
:microtrader-quote:shadowJar

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
```

This will output "fat" jars to the `build/jars/` folder as demonstrated below:

```
$ ls build/jars/

18 Oct 19:59 microtrader-audit-20161018004318.d4ce05e-fat.jar
18 Oct 19:59 microtrader-dashboard-20161018004318.d4ce05e-fat.jar
18 Oct 19:59 microtrader-portfolio-20161018004318.d4ce05e-fat.jar
18 Oct 20:00 microtrader-quote-20161018004318.d4ce05e-fat.jar
```

### Application Versioning

The application uses a simple versioning scheme for all components:

  `<git-commit-timestamp>.<git-commit-short-hash>`

You can use the `make version` command to view the current version.  The versioning scheme also appends a build identifier if the `BUILD_ID` environment variable is set:

```
$ make version
20161018004318.d4ce05e

$ export BUILD_ID=1234
$ make version
20161018004318.d4ce05e.1234
```

### Running the Application Locally

To run the application locally, first execute audit database migrations as demonstrated below to create the initial DB schema.  

Locally this will use HSQL and write to audit-db.* files in the project root:

```
$ java -cp build/jars/microtrader-audit-20161018004318.d4ce05e-fat.jar com.pluralsight.dockerproductionaws.admin.Migrate
Oct 18, 2016 8:18:54 PM org.flywaydb.core.internal.util.VersionPrinter printVersion

drwxr-xr-x  2 jmenga  staff     68  9 Nov 06:00 audit-db.tmp
...
...
```

Next start the audit service, ensuring the `-cluster` flag is set:

```
$ java -jar build/jars/microtrader-audit-20161018004318.d4ce05e-fat.jar -cluster
Oct 18, 2016 8:19:41 PM io.vertx.core.impl.launcher.commands.RunCommand

```

In a new console window, start the portfolio service, ensuring the `-cluster` flag is set.  You should see the cluster members increase to 2 in both console windows.

```
$ java -jar build/jars/microtrader-portfolio-20161018004318.d4ce05e-fat.jar -cluster

```

In another console window, start the quote generator service, once again ensuring the `-cluster` flag is set.  You should see the cluster members increase to 3 in all console windows.

```
$ java -jar build/jars/microtrader-quote-20161018004318.d4ce05e-fat.jar -cluster
Oct 18, 2016 8:19:41 PM io.vertx.core.impl.launcher.commands.RunCommand

```

After the quote generator service has started, you should start to see trading activity in the portfolio service console output:

```
...
...
Bought 1 of Black Coat !
Bought 6 of Divinator !
Bought 2 of Divinator !
Bought 1 of Black Coat !
Bought 2 of Divinator !
...
...
```

Finally, in a new console window, start the trader dashboard service, ensuring the `-cluster` flag is set.  You should see the custer members increase to 4 in all console windows.

```
$ java -jar build/jars/microtrader-dashboard-20161018004318.d4ce05e-fat.jar -cluster

```

At this point, you should be able to browse to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).  

The following screenshot demonstrates a fully functional Microtrader application:

![alt Microtrader Dashboard](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3351083/19468489/16fc6140-9573-11e6-917f-5717e7564d57.png)

### Testing the Application Locally

You can run unit tests using standard gradle tasks:

```
$ ./gradlew clean test
...
...
$ ./gradlew :microtrader-audit:clean :microtrader-audit:test
...
...
```

If you have the application running locally, you can run acceptance tests, which are defined in the [`microtrader-specs`](./microtrader-specs) folder.

These tests are written in JavaScript using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) and test browser-like interactions with the dashboard service and other REST endpoints, as well as the SockJS Event Bus bridge provided by the dashboard service:

> You only need to run the `npm install` commands once

```
microtrader$ cd microtrader-specs
microtrader-specs$ npm install -g mocha
...
...
microtrader-specs$ npm install 
...
...
microtrader-specs$ mocha --exit

```

## Docker Workflow

The repository includes a Docker-based continuous delivery workflow that creates two environments:

- Test Environment
- Release Environment

### Test Environment

The test environment is expressed via a [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker/test/docker-compose.yml) file in the [docker/test](./docker/test) folder.  

The environment defines a single service `test` which creates a Docker development image (defined in [docker/test/Dockerfile](./docker/test/Dockerfile)), which tests and builds the application "fat" jar artefacts.  

All artefacts and test reports are copied to the local `build` folder, so that running tests and builds locally is no different from running the Docker workflow.  

The various actions required to run the tests and build are defined in the `test` task of the local [`Makefile`](./Makefile).

### Release Environment

The release environment is expressed via a [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker/release/docker-compose.yml) file in the [docker/release](./docker/release) folder.  

The release environment defines multiple services:

- Application services - the various application services are built into "release" images as defined in `Dockerfile.<service>` files in the [docker/release](./docker/release) folder.  These images represent the final artifact that will run in production, assuming all future tests and quality checks pass.  Each application service release image is based from the [`microtrader-base`](https://github.com/docker-production-aws/microtrader-base) image.
- Database service - this creates a MySQL database container, which is the database engine used in production
- Helper services - these help orchestrate the correct initialisation and startup of the environment
- Specs service - this runs the acceptance tests defined in the [`microtrader-specs`](./microtrader-specs) folder.

### Running the Workflow

To run the workflow your system must meet the following requirements:

- Docker 1.12 or higher client installed and pointed to a local or remote Docker Engine
- Docker Compose 1.7 or higher
- GNU Make

The workflow consists of the following tasks:

- Test stage - Run unit tests and build artefacts
- Release stage - Build release images and run acceptance tests
- Publish stage - Tag and publish release images to Docker registry

To run the test stage, use the `make test` command:

```
$ make test

After the test stage, application artefacts and test reports will be available in the local `build/jars` and `build/test-reports` folders respectively.

To run the release stage, use the `make release` command:

```

=> Trader dashboard is running at http://172.16.154.128:33166
```

At this point, the release environment is operational and you can actually interact with the application using the URLs shown.

### Publishing Release Images

The final stage is to publish the release images.

To be able to publish your release images, you will need to reconfigure this project to point to a parent repository and Docker registry that you have write access to.

This can be achieved by editing the [`Makefile`](./Makefile) and configuring the `ORG_NAME` and `DOCKER_REGISTRY` settings:

```
...
...
# Project variables
PROJECT_NAME ?= microtrader
ORG_NAME ?= <your-organization>
REPO_NAME ?= microtrader
TEST_REPO_NAME ?= microtrader-dev
DOCKER_REGISTRY ?= <your-registry-url>
...
...
```

After specifying the correct Docker registry and organization name, you next need to ensure you are logged into the Docker registry:

```
$ docker login myregistry.org
Username: justin
Password: **
Login Succeeded
```

Once logged in, you can tag and publish the release images by running `make tag` and `make publish`:

> The workflow includes a `make tag:default` task which tags the image with the current version (i.e. `make version`), short commit hash, any annotated tags that are present on the current commit, and the 'latest' tag

```
$ make tag $(make version) latest
=> Tagging development image with tags 20161018004318.d4ce05e latest...
=> Tagging release images with tags 20161018004318.d4ce05e latest...
=> Tagging complete

$ make publish
=> Publishing development image sha256:fb00a7fb8df435b8189604f761c3e30efceece6f58e67acc5779ee117dd1c623 to docker.io/dockerproductionaws/microtrader-dev...
The push refers to a repository [docker.io/dockerproductionaws/microtrader-dev]
37fc39364752: Pushing 3.429 MB
321ffde7a0f3: Pushing 170.5 kB

...
...
=> Publishing release images to docker.io/dockerproductionaws...
The push refers to a repository [docker.io/dockerproductionaws/microtrader-quote]
...
...
```

### Cleaning Up

To clean up the Docker environments, run the `make clean` task:

```
$ make clean
=> Destroying test environment...
Removing microtradertest_test_1 ... done
Network docker_workflow is external, skipping
=> Destroying release environment...
Stopping microtrader_microtrader-dashboard_1 ... done
Stopping microtrader_microtrader-quote_1 ... done
Stopping microtrader_microtrader-portfolio_1 ... done
Stopping microtrader_microtrader-audit_1 ... done
Stopping microtrader_db_1 ... done
Removing microtrader_specs_1 ... done
Removing microtrader_trader-agent_run_1 ... done
Removing microtrader_microtrader-dashboard_1 ... done

Removing microtrader_audit-db-agent_run_1 ... done
Removing microtrader_db_1 ... done
Network docker_workflow is external, skipping
=> Removing dangling images...
=> Clean complete
```

### Running an End-to-end Workflow

The workflow includes a convenient `make all` task, which automatically runs the following tasks:

- `make clean`
- `make test`
- `make release`
- `make tag:default` - tags the current version (i.e. `make version`), short commit hash, any annotated tags that are present on the current commit and the 'latest' tag
- `make publish`
- `make clean` 

## Environment Configuration Settings

Each application service Docker release image supports a variety of configuration parameters expressed in the form of environment variables.

These settings are based upon two categories:

- Application settings - used to configure the application services.
- Clustering settings - used to control the Hazelcast autodiscovery mechanism used to form clusters.

The following table lists environment variables that configure application settings:

| Scope           | Environment Variable   | Default Value            | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-----------------|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| All             | HTTP_HOST              | localhost                | Defines the hostname of the application service endpoint.  This should be set to the public DNS service name you want other components to reach the service at (e.g. a load balancer endpoint).  This value is published in service discovery records. |
| All             | HTTP_PORT              |                          | Defines the local HTTP port the HTTP service runs on, if an HTTP service is defined for the application service.                                                                                                                                       |
